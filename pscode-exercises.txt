// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

generate random number x
check if x%2 == 0, return even
else return odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a)
generate 5 random numbers and store in a list

b)
sum items of list and divide by length of list

c)
order list smallest to largest 
return 1st element as minimum and last element as maximum

d)
print "The average is [value from step b]
print "The minimum is [1st element from step c] and the maximum is [last element from step c]"
